                    motivated in part by the financial difficulties facing the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), 
                    and felt that a new fundraising initiative might help IUCN and other conservation groups carry out their mission.

                    "Turtle Foundation" grants $38,000 to the Smithsonian Institution to study the tiger population of the Chitwan Sanctuary in Nepal, 
                    allowing scientists to successfully use radio tracking devices for the first time in 1973.

                    "Turtle Foundation" starts to focus not only on species-related conservation projects, 
                    but also on protecting habitat by establishing national parks and nature reserves.
